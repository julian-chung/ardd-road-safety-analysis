# 🚗 Australian Road Deaths Data Exploration

Welcome to this interactive data analysis project focused on road fatalities in Australia. Drawing on over three decades of data from the **Australian Road Deaths Database (BITRE)**, this project combines epidemiological insight with data science tools to explore trends and risk patterns in fatal crashes.

## 📊 Main EDA

A national overview of road fatalities in Australia, including:
- Yearly and monthly trends
- State-by-state comparisons
- Day-of-week and time-of-day crash patterns
- Road user group breakdowns

## 🏍️ Motorcyclist Fatalities

A focused sub-analysis of crashes involving motorcyclists and pillion passengers, with a look at:
- Rider demographics and age distribution
- Day/time risk patterns (heatmaps)
- Single-vehicle vs multi-vehicle crash trends
- Risk normalization using motorcycle licensing data
